# Tabler Figma Dashboard UI Kit

[Tabler](https://tabler.io/) is a free and open-source HTML Dashboard UI Kit built on Bootstrap, providing a solid foundation for web developers. However, the absence of a Figma file creates challenges for designers and businesses who need to prototype quickly and efficiently. We are developing an open-source Figma design board for Tabler to solve this. Our Figma board will mirror all the UI components, making it easier for designers to create high-fidelity prototypes and for businesses to streamline their design process. We would like to invite contributions and feedback to enhance this tool for the design community.
