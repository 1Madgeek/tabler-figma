# Tabler Figma Dashboard UI Kit

[Tabler](https://tabler.io/) is a free and open-source HTML Dashboard UI Kit built on Bootstrap, providing a solid foundation for web developers. However, the absence of a Figma file creates challenges for designers and businesses who need to prototype quickly and efficiently. We are developing an open-source Figma design board for Tabler to solve this. Our Figma board will mirror all the UI components, making it easier for designers to create high-fidelity prototypes and for businesses to streamline their design process. We would like to invite contributions and feedback to enhance this tool for the design community.

## Figma Design Board

Check out the [Figma design board](https://www.figma.com/design/v6gnDiEWtSk0kxScI6sN3z/Tabler-Ui-Kit?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas) for this project. Weâ€™re building an open-source Figma kit for the Tabler UI components.


## Feedback and Suggestions

Weâ€™re building this Figma design kit to help the community, and your feedback would be invaluable! If you have any suggestions, ideas, or improvements, weâ€™d love to hear them.

Feel free to leave your feedback or suggestions in the [Tabler GitHub discussion post](https://github.com/tabler/tabler/discussions/1973) where weâ€™re coordinating with the community.

Thank you for your support and contributions!
